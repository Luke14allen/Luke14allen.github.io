    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: Michael </p>

    <h2>1:1 Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction?</h2>
    <h3> Because It shows that either imput are true but both are not true</h3>
    <p>This is an answer in the format of a full sentence.</p>

    <h2>2:1 Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table ralted only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n</h2>
    <h3>Because it helps us get a straghtforward way to specify the nessisary amount of outputs for specified inputs. and it uses the formula 2^n because there are 2 possible outcomes for n which is why it is 2n</h3>
    

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned some basics for boolean algebra</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when just reading it. There is a lot to process and I  dont even fully understand it that much right now.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by maybe having videos that ran through some examples or something/which is what im watching my own online. But just reading the wiki is hard for me to get an understanding of it all.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that there is a lot more to learn for computer science.</p>

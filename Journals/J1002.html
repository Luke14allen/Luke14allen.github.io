      I assisted: tarun
      I received assistance from tarun
      1.1 Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model.
      Discord and valorant.

      2.1:It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?It appears that both Jack Williams and John Will\
      iams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why? Because if they share the names of the directory then if they are working with each other, they can\
      know that it is the same project and make sure they are opening the same work. Rather than it being confusing and they have two different names for it.
      3.1 why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?
      I think it uses this symbol to show that its a different place then others. So that when you see it you know it has to do with the home directory and nothing else

      4.1  Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this?  Yes the prompt changed and its useful by giving you more information and a better format to work on.
   
      5.1/2:What happens each time you press the up/down arrow keys?
      You will be shifted up/down depending if you hit the up or down arrow keys to the previous commands.

      6.1 :Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?
      No, after I did this one I could not see the "Hello, World!". I think this could have been do to it moving to a different file.

      7.1 How does the ls command differ from the tree command?
      I don't really know but I do know that it shows a tree of the commands.
</br>
      7.2 how do you choose to use one over the other?
      I guess its just which one fits the situation better.
     </br>
     8.1 What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?34
      Well the first time I used sleep 3 it didn't do anything. But when I ran sleep 5 it put a sleep in front of my sleep 5 text. I think maybe its cancels/makes the command take long to start.
     </br>
     8.2 Are you able to prove your hypothesis? how?
      I could try and run some commands and see what happens.
</br> 
      9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?
      It just gave me some random number after I ran sleep 60.
</br>
      9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?
      Have something working while you are working on a different part.
</br>
      9.3 What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?
      | Maybe the number of things the computer is doing.
</br>
      10.1 What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?
      It showed all of the sleep commands that I previously did.
      </br>
      10.2 How do you explain your observations? When I ran the sleep commands they started running as jobs in the background.

      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? I've just learned some simple things about how everything works and its foundation.

      What challenges did I encounter?
      Just taking in all this new information is a little challenging.
      How could this experience be improved? Maybe more videos I could watch and follow to make sure im on the right path. It would be nice to have a video comparison while learning.

      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
      Well I know more now than when I started this class. However it has stressed me out a bit the work and its not easy for me to memorize all these commands and how to work through tabby. However i'm sure that the more I use it the better I will end up getting.

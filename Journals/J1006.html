<p>1:1 What is git commuincating to you?
I think its commuincating that I made my first file and when I did it.</p>

<p>1:2:what do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?
They both talk about the new file.</p>

<p>1:3why do you think this is?
Because doing this made a git file.</p>

<p>2:1 what do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? how are they displayed in git status?
They are displayed in green right next to each other.</p>

<p>2:2 are they both displayed in the same section? if not, why not?
I dont think they are, Im kind of confused.</p>

<p>3:1 what do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
Well they are both green and one is on top of the other. As well as one says modified and one says new file.</p>

<p>3:2 compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.
One has a modified script to the left of it. While the other just has a new file one.</p>

<p>4:1 How many files are listed as having been changed?
1 file was changed when I typed something.</p>

<p> 4:2 What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?
everything is listed in white and blue except my change which is highlighted in a green.</p>

<p> 5:1 what does git tell you has changed? why?
It doesnt tell me annything has changed. It just goes on to the text line.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
        <p>I learned all about files and how to modifie them.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
        <p>I encountered challlenges when I was trying to find this file I didn't understand how to get back here. So I needed to get the help from Ms.Jang after asking my shoulder partners</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
        <p>This experience could be imporved if maybe there was a video tutorial or something, rather than just reading and coppying. </p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
        <p>I now realize that this is much more complex than I previously thought. </p>
